# Prediciting-Loan-Defaults

The dataset was about optimizing the predictive power of a borrowerâ€™s credit worthiness
analyzed by the machine learning model based on their concurrent and past profile to minimize
the risk of future loan defaults for financial institutions. This would automate the process for
banks to accept or reject an applicant. This was a supervised binary classification problem with a
highly imbalanced data that was assessed through ROC AUC and Precision-Recall curves. The
data was extracted from Kaggle which had 20000 rows of numerical and categorical data to
begin with. 

The objective of this project is to train our machine learning model in such a way that it can
predict the probability of a loan defaulting with the help of the available variables. Because loan
providers are risking the amount of loan, developing a model that minimizes the risk of default
by considering probabilities and best decision paths, and also maximizing profitability by
providing different interest rates to the loan takers based on their probabilities of default is our
aim.
